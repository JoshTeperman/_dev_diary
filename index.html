        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 56</p>
        <p>Spent the morning workin on CodeWars problems (5 and 4kyu). They're getting more difficult, I often have to research algorithms to find the answer.</p>
        <p>Nearly finished the Rails Introductory Tutorial - this will be perfect for setting up Codely. Same type of workflow.</p>

        <p>All coding today on Codewars problems. Looking to hit 5kyu by the weekend.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 54</p>
        <p>Up at 6am. Day 3 of the holiday. Worked on the Slack app in the morning but having trouble hosting Sinatra apps on Heroku.</p>
        <p> Met Ryan from Culture Amp for a coffee, then did some coding at school before the Ruby Hack Night. Created the database structure for Codely and then moved on to studying Rails so I can start hosting apps on Heroku.</p>

      </div>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 53</p>
        <p>Made some progress on Codely - mocked up the db structure for one of the tables in SQLite and starting to put the pages together. Did a bunch of research into Sinatra / Rails file structure and what all the files / default code means. Also spent 2 days getting used to Rake and SQLite syntax. Still need to learn how to make more complex table structures - one to many, many to many in particular for Codely.</p>
        <p>Attempted to upload my first draft of Codely to Heroku and got an error - not recognising the format.</p>
        <p>Went through 66% of the Java course on CodeAcademy. Not too bad so far, just super long syntax I'll have to be careful with. Set up Java development environment and installed Android Studio. Next step is to finish the Java course and look up QR Code tutorials to make an App!</p>
        <p>Did sine research on Slack API / Slack bots / Slack command apps for TacoCat. Found a good tutorial to work through for a weather app specifically written in my tech stack (Sinatra / Heroku) which is perfect. Will try and swap in my idea for TacoCat and see if it works. Also so some tutorials for the MERN stack which I'd like to have a go at.</p>
        <p>Also put down some new ideas for my personal site (as opposed to portfolio site). Really like <a href="https://healeycodes.github.io/">Andrew Healey</a> website and would like to do something similar - blog posts on the main page, portfolio, Art etc etc. Also like the simplicity of the design and the icons.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 51</p>
        <p>Decided to take the extra sleep and go wake up at 8am instead of 5am today. Was nearly dead yesterday so needed it. 
        <p>Plan this weekend is to a) connect to another API, b) create database for SQLite for CodeGoggles, and c) tinker with a QR code maker to share contact information.</p>
        <p>Tuesday is the Ruby Hackathon, and I want to get work done on CodeGoggles there.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 50</p>
        <p>END OF TERM 1!</p>
        <p>Spent the rest of the day getting PhotoSplash working - created a search bar that takes search query and sends an authenticated GET request to the Unsplash API to retrieve photos. Photos are intitialized into Ruby objects that can be dynamically converted to HTML.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day I set up a Heroku account and tried to deploy the app, but couldn't get Heroku to recognise the Ruby framework. Seems there's something wrong wih the file structure - probably Config or the Proc file.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 48</p>
        <p>Today we learned Sinatra, Ruby framework used to depoloy a simple web server and erb (embedded ruby) for dynamic HTML pages. Used that to pull JSON files from APIs to pupulate our site. Had a quick practise creating a MVC structure, but need to make a couple of things with it to make it muscle memory.</p> 
        <p>Connected to the Unsplash API before bed using authorization. For starters want to make a webapp that returns photo from search bar.</p>
        <p>Rest of this week is deeper dive into MVC and building a web app on Friday. Want to work on my CodeWars project.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 47</p>
        <p>Up at 5:45. Catching the tram this month, takes about 40mins. Been doing some extra reading this week and more work on CodeWars. Want to hit lvl 5 minimum and learn to write better, cleaner code. 
        <p>Still reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Complete-Software-Developers-Career-Guide-ebook/dp/B073X6GNJ1">The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide</a> but want to get stuck into Sandi Metz' <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles">99 bottles of OOP</a> as well.</p>
        <p>Also want to work more on building online presence - blog posts, improve personal site.</p>
        <p>At school learned SQL commands. Spun up a database both in terminal with psql gem and Postgres OS App, and also using the Postico GUI. The pg gem looks really interesting for running SQL queries directly from within Ruby code. Excited to finally connect front end to back end.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 46</p>
        <p>Worked on Code Goggles in the morning (really need a better name). Getting file system working - creating new problems & solutions, and saving to file.</p> 
        <p>School topic was Model View Controller, and refactoring code to fit that new model. Separating code into separate files responsible for one of the three. Model (storing and manipulating data, responding to requests for data) View (UI, user interacts and sends requests for information to Model via Controller), and Controller (the business logic, runs the program, sends commands to View telling it what to show, sends requests and commands to Model). View and Model were both created as object instances within Controller, so that V&M don't necessaritly know each other exist (can't directly affect the other), but Controller has access to everything.</p>

        <p>Up at 6:40. Cats were distracing. Continuing with practicing writing tests (for CodeWars challenges) and debugging. Useful tool, but frustrating because everything has to be 100% accurate before you can move on, and you keep catching random edge cases you hadn't thought of. That's the point I suppose.</p>

        <p>Up at 6, cafe by 7am. Doing a 5 minute Lightning Talk today on Interview Prep from Recruiter's Perspective.</p>
        <p>Class topic was Databases. Started with basic theory and whipped up some PostgreSQL style tables on DbDesigner.</p>
        <p>Talk was well received, so I uploaded the talk to Speakerdeck: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/joshteperman/interview-advice-from-an-ex-recruiter">Interview Advice from an (ex) Recruiter</a></p>

        <p>1000 Days of Code: Day 42</p>
        <p>Testing best practises, Regex email tests, and using DateTime interpolation in class. Little bit more class / instance method practise.</p>
        <p><em>Notes on Web App Architecture:</em><br>Differences between server side programs and browser side programs. Server side app component stores, updates, and writes data, and sends messages via HTTP to the web server in a format that is readable, telling it how to render a page. Ensures inbound messages are in a format readable to the server. Server software can not be seen by the client and can only be accessed by HTTP request. Handles authentication / permissions. Can be written in any language that can parse HTTP requests, most common are Ruby (Rails), Python (Django), PHP, .NET, C#, Java JS (Node.js).</p>
        <p>In-browser application components tell are visible to the client and tell the browser how to render the page. Almost exclusively written in HTML, CSS, Javascript. Client can interact with / change how the browser displays. Based on client interaction, send new requests (via HTTP) to the server (POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE), which depending on structure tell the server side app software how/what requests to make of the database.</p>
        <p>Modern web-app architecture trending towareds: software-as-a-service architecture (easier to scale / spin up quickly, less overhead, no need for dedicated physical server etc etc), single-page applications (uses Javascript to create the web-page in-browser that reacts to User Input through GUI, as opposed to being rendered server side, much faster and closer to feeling of Desktop App), relational databases.</p>
        <p>Apart from above, read up on Docker & containerisation vs traditional infrastructure / onion & hexagonal architecture. Definitely want to learn both Docker and microservices as they seem to be the best tool-kit to allow for both fast/easy/low-overhead and complex/scalable/higher-overhead solutions. Will learn using this course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/?couponCode=4TWI10">Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide on Udemy</a></p>

        <p>More Ruby review today.</p>
        <p>Ruby test. Was easy.</p>
        <p>Nearly finished the latest round of Ruby Challenges. Getting much better at using Classes.</p>
        <p>Went home and worked on remaining Ruby Fundamentals. Challenges that stumped me before seemed pretty easy now. Progress!</p>
        <p>Made first commits to <a href="https://github.com/JoshTeperman/code_goggles" target="_blank">Code Goggles</a>. Using links to Gists could be a way to get something up and running without having to deal with MySQL etc. Going to have to learn about architecture though. Best way to structure a website and how the pieces fit together.</p>

        <p>Completed the site including night mode. Wrote the readme file and finished documentation. Submitted completed project at 1:30pm.</p>
        <p>Done for now. Still want to fix mobile, move location of Navbar, and add funcionality to Project Tiles for Mobile and Tablet.</p>
        <p>Itching to get on to some other projects. In particular a web scraper of some kind (want to play with APIs and do something with Bitcoin. Also want to get a head start on Javascript and make some basic apps.</p>

        <p>Mocked up Home page no problem, but had issues gettt the components to sit flush resizing for tablet.</p>
        <p>Started thinking about how I would execute <a href="https://github.com/JoshTeperman/code_goggles">Code Goggles</a>. Need to learn MySQL to store user data and challenges. Upvoting easy - score / weight algorithm. User login with server-side auth. Initial challenges are going to be how users (teachers only? or students as well?) add new challenges, and how I limit that. Codewars style of adding new short challenges would be cool too.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 27</p>
        <p>Started HTML and CSS classes. Loved Harrison's idea of a GitHub Pages-hosted dev blog, started this blog. Idea is to write short daily updates and push daily to GitHub. Link to longer form blog-post.</p>
        <p>Takes the pressure off writing long form pieces, and a good way to go over what I've learned, keep notes of important stuff.</p>
