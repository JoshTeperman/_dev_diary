        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 30</p>
        <p>Up at 6, at the cafe by 7:10.</p>
        <p>Studied CSS Grid in class. Lots of practise mocking up static webpages with grid and flexbox.</p>
        <p>Portfolio site challenge starts next week so looked at example portfolio sites.</p>
        <p>Only went to the gym once this week. Aim for 3 times a week minimum.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 29</p>
        <p>Up at 6:00, cafe by 7:10</p>
        <p>Decided on topic for 5 min-talk: something to do with advice from recruiter</p>
        <p>This week must contanct Nabila (Square) again, and also reach out to hiring managers for coffee.</p>
        <p>Need to get basic portfolio / personal website up and running + linkedin page before that.</p>
        <p>Skills to go over: basic CSS (making shapes, backgrounds), file I/O for Ruby, classes for Ruby.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 28</p>
        <p>Awake from 4am thinking about programming and at local cafe by 6.</p>
        <p>Studied basic CSS properties. Getting the hang of using divs & margin to make basic shapes like buttons</p>
        <p>Started my component library.</p>
        <p>Used Figma for the first time. Very useful / intuitive for bootstrapping designs.</p>
        <p>11 hours of coding today. Went home and watched Pro Chess League before bed.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 27</p>
        <p>Started HTML and CSS classes. Loved Harrison's idea of a GitHub Pages-hosted dev blog, started this blog. Idea is to write short daily updates and push daily to GitHub. Link to longer form content.</p>
        <p>Takes the pressure off writing long form pieces, and a good way to go over what I've learned, keep notes of important stuff.</p>
