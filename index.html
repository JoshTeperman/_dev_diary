        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 33</p>
        <p>Up at 5:40, at cafe by 7. This week is all about portfolio site. Must concentrate on clean code first, then get fancy only if I have time.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 32</p>
        <p>Up at 6am. Fished the CSS Grid exercises before breakfast. Plan today is to decide concept for portfolio site, and hopefully start Figma mock-up.</p>
        <p>Completed basic greyscale front page for portfolio site. Basic colour scheme next (night theme?)</p>
        <p>Must also consider mobile users / responsive site design</p>
        <p>Idea for blog post - colour deign / colour values for design mockups (draw on art background)</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 31</p>
        <p>Up at 6:30, had an hour while N slept.</p>
        <p>Looking at Lambda school student projects for ideas for an open source side-project challenge with other students.</p>
        <p>These both looked cool: <a href="https://github.com/mckaywrigley/React-Insta-Clone/tree/mckay-wrigley">Insta Clone</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1106610732999675904">Fitness App</a>.</p>
        <p>comfortable with basic mock-ups now, time to start work on portfolio site.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 28</p>
        <p>Awake from 4am thinking about programming and at local cafe by 6.</p>
        <p>Studied basic CSS properties. Getting the hang of using divs & margin to make basic shapes like buttons</p>
        <p>Started my component library.</p>
        <p>Used Figma for the first time. Very useful / intuitive for bootstrapping designs.</p>
        <p>11 hours of coding today. Went home and watched Pro Chess League before bed.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 27</p>
        <p>Started HTML and CSS classes. Loved Harrison's idea of a GitHub Pages-hosted dev blog, started this blog. Idea is to write short daily updates and push daily to GitHub. Link to longer form content.</p>
        <p>Takes the pressure off writing long form pieces, and a good way to go over what I've learned, keep notes of important stuff.</p>
