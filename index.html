        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 39</p>
        <p>Up at 6:30.</p>
        <p>Had a leisurely breakfast and coffee with N.</p>
        <p>Completed the site including night mode. Wrote the readme file and finished documentation. Submitted completed project at 1:30pm.</p>
        <p>Done for now. Still want to fix mobile, move location of Navbar, and add funcionality to Project Tiles for Mobile and Tablet.</p>
        <p>Itching to get on to some other projects. In particular a web scraper of some kind (want to play with APIs and do something with Bitcoin. Also want to get a head start on Javascript and make some basic apps.</p>
        <p>Just purchased a React/Redux coure on Udemy.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 38</p>
        <p>Up at 6:30, Some coding before N gets up. Have a couple of hours while N at work today.</p>
        <p>Want to complete alignment issues for my portfolio site and smash out the Readme file. Then can try for a couple of extra features.</p>
        <p>Got most of the alignment issues in the afternoon and went to the gym.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 37</p>
        <p>Up at 5:40, cafe by 6:50</p>
        <p>Completed bare bones of the app today. Desktop View is fairly clean. Still have issues with how the letters align on tablet and mobile. My want to try coding each word as a block to avoid this, but won't be able to animate individual letters.</p>
        <p>Site is now live at <a href="josht.dev" target="_blank">www.josht.dev</a>. Hosted on Netlify.</p>
        <p>Feeling much more comfortable with CSS and HTML basics, ready to learn Javascript and got back to OOL.</p>

        <p>Up at 5:45, cafe by 7:05</p>
        <p>Continuing work on portfolio site. Most urgent tasks are completing code for Home Tablet and Mobile, then extending to About, Projects, and Contact Pages which should be much easier.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 35</p>
        <p>Up at 5:30, cafe by 7</p>
        <p>Working on CSS/HTML of portfolio site today</p>
        <p>Mocked up Home page no problem, but had issues gettt the components to sit flush resizing for tablet.</p>
        <p>Started thinking about how I would execute <a href="https://github.com/JoshTeperman/code_goggles">Code Goggles</a>. Need to learn MySQL to store user data and challenges. Upvoting easy - score / weight algorithm. User login with server-side auth. Initial challenges are going to be how users (teachers only? or students as well?) add new challenges, and how I limit that. Codewars style of adding new short challenges would be cool too.</p>
        <p>Felt crazy tired after coding today, had a big nap.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 34</p>
        <p>Up at 6, at the cafe by 7. Stellar effort.</p>          
        <p>Today will be all Figma / Design for portfolio site.</p>
        <p>Completed wireframes and designs for Home and About pages. Initial designs for Contact and Projects, but not entirely happy</p>
        <p>Designing the site has given me several ideas for other features : Dark Theme, Colour Randomiser, Rain animation, click-to-interact.</p>
        <p>Need to solve for how animations would work on mobile (no hover).</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 33</p>
        <p>Up at 5:40, at cafe by 7. This week is all about portfolio site. Must concentrate on clean code first, then get fancy only if I have time.</p>
        <p>Areas for review: Still need to go back to Ruby classes & fundamentals, data structures.</p>
        <p>Need more CSS practise (Zen Blog)</p>
        <p>Class work: couple of videos on design. More about Figma. We have 2.5 days to complete wireframes, mood board and overall design so will spend more time on this.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 32</p>
        <p>Up at 6am. Fished the CSS Grid exercises before breakfast. Plan today is to decide concept for portfolio site, and hopefully start Figma mock-up.</p>
        <p>Completed basic greyscale front page for portfolio site. Basic colour scheme next (night theme?)</p>
        <p>Must also consider mobile users / responsive site design</p>
        <p>Idea for blog post - colour deign / colour values for design mockups (draw on art background)</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 31</p>
        <p>Up at 6:30, had an hour while N slept.</p>
        <p>Looking at Lambda school student projects for ideas for an open source side-project challenge with other students.</p>
        <p>These both looked cool: <a href="https://github.com/mckaywrigley/React-Insta-Clone/tree/mckay-wrigley">Insta Clone</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1106610732999675904">Fitness App</a>.</p>
        <p>comfortable with basic mock-ups now, time to start work on portfolio site.</p>

        <p>Portfolio site challenge starts next week so looked at example portfolio sites.</p>

        <p>Up at 6:00, cafe by 7:10</p>
        <p>Studied Flex-box in class. Added flexbox to this devblog and fixed the navbar.</p>
        <p>Decided on topic for 5 min-talk: something to do with advice from recruiter</p>
        <p>This week must contanct Nabila (Square) again, and also reach out to hiring managers for coffee.</p>
        <p>Need to get basic portfolio / personal website up and running + linkedin page before that.</p>
        <p>Skills to go over: basic CSS (making shapes, backgrounds), file I/O for Ruby, classes for Ruby.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 28</p>
        <p>Awake from 4am thinking about programming and at local cafe by 6.</p>
        <p>Studied basic CSS properties. Getting the hang of using divs & margin to make basic shapes like buttons</p>
        <p>Started my component library.</p>
        <p>Used Figma for the first time. Very useful / intuitive for bootstrapping designs.</p>
        <p>11 hours of coding today. Went home and watched Pro Chess League before bed.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 27</p>
        <p>Started HTML and CSS classes. Loved Harrison's idea of a GitHub Pages-hosted dev blog, started this blog. Idea is to write short daily updates and push daily to GitHub. Link to longer form content.</p>
        <p>Takes the pressure off writing long form pieces, and a good way to go over what I've learned, keep notes of important stuff.</p>
