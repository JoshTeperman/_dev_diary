        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 43</p>
        <p>Up at 6, cafe by 7am. Doing a 5 minute Lightning Talk today on Interview Prep from Recruiter's Perspective.</p>
        <p>Class topic is Databases</p>

        <p>1000 Days of Code: Day 42</p>
        <p>Testing best practises, Regex email tests, and using DateTime interpolation in class. Little bit more class / instance method practise.</p>
        <p><em>Notes on Web App Architecture:</em><br>Differences between server side programs and browser side programs. Server side app component stores, updates, and writes data, and sends messages via HTTP to the web server in a format that is readable, telling it how to render a page. Ensures inbound messages are in a format readable to the server. Server software can not be seen by the client and can only be accessed by HTTP request. Handles authentication / permissions. Can be written in any language that can parse HTTP requests, most common are Ruby (Rails), Python (Django), PHP, .NET, C#, Java JS (Node.js).</p>
        <p>In-browser application components tell are visible to the client and tell the browser how to render the page. Almost exclusively written in HTML, CSS, Javascript. Client can interact with / change how the browser displays. Based on client interaction, send new requests (via HTTP) to the server (POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE), which depending on structure tell the server side app software how/what requests to make of the database.</p>
        <p>Modern web-app architecture trending towareds: software-as-a-service architecture (easier to scale / spin up quickly, less overhead, no need for dedicated physical server etc etc), single-page applications (uses Javascript to create the web-page in-browser that reacts to User Input through GUI, as opposed to being rendered server side, much faster and closer to feeling of Desktop App), relational databases.</p>
        <p>Apart from above, read up on Docker & containerisation vs traditional infrastructure / onion & hexagonal architecture. Definitely want to learn both Docker and microservices as they seem to be the best tool-kit to allow for both fast/easy/low-overhead and complex/scalable/higher-overhead solutions. Will learn using this course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/?couponCode=4TWI10">Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide on Udemy</a></p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 41</p>
        <p>Up at 6:45. Cafe at 7:10</p>
        <p>Spent the morning refactoring the _dev_bog website code while Joe Hisashi kept me company. Still need to fix mobile text size and move the nav bar but much cleaner.</p>
        <p>Ruby study during the day at school. Learned how yield works and wrote my own .map and .each functions.</p>
        <p>Spent the evening studying web application architecture basics for Code Goggles. Need a new name for that btw.</p>

        <p>Up at 6:45. Cafe at 7:01</p>
        <p>More Ruby review today.</p>
        <p>Ruby test. Was easy.</p>
        <p>Nearly finished the latest round of Ruby Challenges. Getting much better at using Classes.</p>
        <p>Went home and worked on remaining Ruby Fundamentals. Challenges that stumped me before seemed pretty easy now. Progress!</p>
        <p>Made first commits to <a href="https://github.com/JoshTeperman/code_goggles" target="_blank">Code Goggles</a>. Using links to Gists could be a way to get something up and running without having to deal with MySQL etc. Going to have to learn about architecture though. Best way to structure a website and how the pieces fit together.</p>

        <p>Up at 6:30.</p>
        <p>Had a leisurely breakfast and coffee with N.</p>
        <p>Completed the site including night mode. Wrote the readme file and finished documentation. Submitted completed project at 1:30pm.</p>
        <p>Done for now. Still want to fix mobile, move location of Navbar, and add funcionality to Project Tiles for Mobile and Tablet.</p>
        <p>Itching to get on to some other projects. In particular a web scraper of some kind (want to play with APIs and do something with Bitcoin. Also want to get a head start on Javascript and make some basic apps.</p>
        <p>Just purchased a React/Redux coure on Udemy.</p>

        <p>Up at 6:30, Some coding before N gets up. Have a couple of hours while N at work today.</p>
        <p>Want to complete alignment issues for my portfolio site and smash out the Readme file. Then can try for a couple of extra features.</p>
        <p>Got most of the alignment issues in the afternoon and went to the gym.</p>

        <p>Up at 5:40, cafe by 6:50</p>
        <p>Completed bare bones of the app today. Desktop View is fairly clean. Still have issues with how the letters align on tablet and mobile. My want to try coding each word as a block to avoid this, but won't be able to animate individual letters.</p>
        <p>Site is now live at <a href="josht.dev" target="_blank">www.josht.dev</a>. Hosted on Netlify.</p>
        <p>Feeling much more comfortable with CSS and HTML basics, ready to learn Javascript and got back to OOL.</p>

        <p>Up at 5:45, cafe by 7:05</p>
        <p>Continuing work on portfolio site. Most urgent tasks are completing code for Home Tablet and Mobile, then extending to About, Projects, and Contact Pages which should be much easier.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 35</p>
        <p>Up at 5:30, cafe by 7</p>
        <p>Working on CSS/HTML of portfolio site today</p>
        <p>Mocked up Home page no problem, but had issues gettt the components to sit flush resizing for tablet.</p>
        <p>Started thinking about how I would execute <a href="https://github.com/JoshTeperman/code_goggles">Code Goggles</a>. Need to learn MySQL to store user data and challenges. Upvoting easy - score / weight algorithm. User login with server-side auth. Initial challenges are going to be how users (teachers only? or students as well?) add new challenges, and how I limit that. Codewars style of adding new short challenges would be cool too.</p>
        <p>Felt crazy tired after coding today, had a big nap.</p>

        <p>Up at 6, at the cafe by 7. Stellar effort.</p>          
        <p>Today will be all Figma / Design for portfolio site.</p>
        <p>Completed wireframes and designs for Home and About pages. Initial designs for Contact and Projects, but not entirely happy</p>
        <p>Designing the site has given me several ideas for other features : Dark Theme, Colour Randomiser, Rain animation, click-to-interact.</p>
        <p>Need to solve for how animations would work on mobile (no hover).</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 31</p>
        <p>Up at 6:30, had an hour while N slept.</p>
        <p>Looking at Lambda school student projects for ideas for an open source side-project challenge with other students.</p>
        <p>These both looked cool: <a href="https://github.com/mckaywrigley/React-Insta-Clone/tree/mckay-wrigley">Insta Clone</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1106610732999675904">Fitness App</a>.</p>
        <p>comfortable with basic mock-ups now, time to start work on portfolio site.</p>

        <p>Up at 6:00, cafe by 7:10</p>
        <p>Studied Flex-box in class. Added flexbox to this devblog and fixed the navbar.</p>
        <p>Decided on topic for 5 min-talk: something to do with advice from recruiter</p>
        <p>This week must contanct Nabila (Square) again, and also reach out to hiring managers for coffee.</p>
        <p>Need to get basic portfolio / personal website up and running + linkedin page before that.</p>
        <p>Skills to go over: basic CSS (making shapes, backgrounds), file I/O for Ruby, classes for Ruby.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 28</p>
        <p>Awake from 4am thinking about programming and at local cafe by 6.</p>
        <p>Studied basic CSS properties. Getting the hang of using divs & margin to make basic shapes like buttons</p>
        <p>Started my component library.</p>
        <p>Used Figma for the first time. Very useful / intuitive for bootstrapping designs.</p>
        <p>11 hours of coding today. Went home and watched Pro Chess League before bed.</p>

        <p>#1000 Days of Code: Day 27</p>
        <p>Started HTML and CSS classes. Loved Harrison's idea of a GitHub Pages-hosted dev blog, started this blog. Idea is to write short daily updates and push daily to GitHub. Link to longer form blog-post.</p>
        <p>Takes the pressure off writing long form pieces, and a good way to go over what I've learned, keep notes of important stuff.</p>
